### 🔐 Role-Based Access

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| Admin | Full platform control — `/admin/*` routes |
| Resident | Personal portal — `/resident/*` routes |
| Security | Gate management — `/security/*` routes |

- Wrong-role users are automatically redirected to their own dashboard
- All routes are protected via `ProtectedRoute.js` with Firebase Auth enforcement

### 🗄️ Firestore Collections

| Collection | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| users | User profiles with role + societyId |
| societies | Society metadata |
| flats | Flat registry per society |
| residents | Resident records |
| staff | Staff/security members |
| bills | Maintenance bills |
| complaints | Resident complaints |
| announcements | Society notices & events |
| visitors | Visitor check-in/out logs |
| visitor_preapprovals | Pre-approved visitor requests |
| visitor_blacklist | Blacklisted individuals |
| attendance | Staff attendance records |
| emergencies | Emergency alerts & SOS |
| documents | Society documents |
| app_settings | Society-level settings |

### ⚡ Multi-Tenant Model
Every piece of business data is scoped by `societyId`. Each society operates in complete isolation — residents, billing, complaints & visitors never cross between societies.

### 🔄 Real-Time Architecture
All modules use Firebase `onSnapshot` listeners. Changes made in any portal reflect instantly across all connected sessions — no polling, no page refresh required.
